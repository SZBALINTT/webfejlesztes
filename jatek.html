        <h2>About the Game</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <section class="block">
            <p>
                Metro Exodus is a first-person shooter video game that was developed by 4A Games and published by Deep
                Silver. It is the third installment in the Metro video game series, which is based on Dmitry
                Glukhovsky's novels. The game is a sequel to Metro: Last Light and the book Metro 2035, and follows
                protagonist Artyom and his crew as they flee the Moscow Metro and set off with their allies on an
                intercontinental journey to the Far East on a locomotive called Aurora. The story takes place over a
                year, during which Artyom visits locations such as the Volga River and the Caspian Sea. The game
                improves on the gameplay mechanics of Last Light; it includes several miniature open world locations and
                has linear levels like earlier games in the series.

                Starting in 2014, the game was developed by a team of around 150 based in Kyiv and Malta. The Exodus
                studio's main objective was to combine the core gameplay pillars of the Metro series with elements from
                S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl (2007), which prioritizes emergent gameplay and features a large,
                explorable space. The team experimented with open-world gameplay and excluded mission markers so that
                players can explore naturally. 4A collaborated with Glukhovsky on the game's story, which focuses more
                on Artyom's personal story and relationships, forgoing some of the supernatural elements found in
                previous games for a more grounded story.

                Metro Exodus was announced in 2017, and was released for PlayStation 4, Windows and Xbox One in 2019. An
                upgraded version of the game titled Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition was released for Windows, PlayStation
                5, and Xbox Series X/S in 2021. Metro Exodus received generally favorable reviews from critics, who
                praised its visuals, game design, and story but criticized its English voice acting and technical issues
                at launch. The game has sold over 8.5 million units as of March 2023. Two downloadable expansions titled
                The Two Colonels and Sam's Story, each of which features a new playable character, were released in
                August 2019 and February 2020, respectively. In November 2020, it was announced that a sequel is in
                development.

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <section class="block">
            <p>Like earlier games in the series, Metro Exodus is a first-person shooter. The player controls
                player-character Artyom, who must leave the tunnels of Moscow and travel across the post-apocalyptic
                wasteland of the former Russian Federation and Republic of Kazakhstan while fighting against mutated
                creatures and hostile humans. The game occurs in one in-game year; environments change along with the
                seasons as the story progresses. Like earlier Metro games, Metro Exodus includes linear missions and
                introduces several large, open spaces for players to explore. Using binoculars, players can identify
                points of interest in the game's map. Players can find collectible items such as diary entries and
                postcards. Some areas are severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn due to toxic air. Each gas
                filter lasts one minute each, and these must be replaced provided the player has more in reserve.
                Players must wipe off dirt and blood splatter that collect on the gas mask, which may crack if it is
                damaged, and players must temporarily repair it using duct tape. The game features a minimalist
                head-up display (HUD); information is usually displayed to the player through tangible objects. For
                instance, a timer on Artyom's wristwatch shows how long until the current filter expires. A compass
                that displays the direction of their objectives can be attached to the wristwatch.

                Players can use firearms such as pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles, and submachine guns, as well as
                air-powered weapons such as the Tikhar and the Helsing crossbow, to defeat enemies. Consumables such
                as Molotov cocktails and grenades can also be used against enemies. The player can carry three weapons
                at any one time. Players can swap their equipped weapons with those they find in the game world; weapons
                may also be dismantled for parts and resources. Weapons can be extensively customized; for instance, a
                laser sight may be attached to a weapon to increase its accuracy.

                Players must scavenge for resources as they explore the game's world. In addition to ammunition, players
                must collect "chemicals" and "materials", both of which are necessary for crafting new consumables and
                ammunition. Players can craft gas filters, medkits, and ammunition for air-powered weapons by deploying
                Artyom's backpack. Ammunition for regular weapons must be crafted at workbenches on Aurora. At
                workbenches, players can also permanently repair their gas masks and clean their weapons. Performance of
                uncleaned weapons will decrease and they may jam during combat. Through exploring and completing side
                activities, players will find new gears and upgrades; for instance, they will acquire night-vision
                goggles in the Volga River map and a motion tracker in the Caspian Sea level, both of which can aid the
                player in combat.

                Players can approach their missions in a variety of ways. They can use stealth tactics such as
                turning off lights to remain hidden and throwing a can to distract enemies. Alternatively, they can use
                a lethal approach such as tossing a throwing knife at enemies to quietly kill them. Players are
                encouraged to plan before approaching a mission. The behavior of enemies, which are controlled by
                artificial intelligence, may change depending on the time of day. For instance, enemies patrolling a
                camp during daytime may retreat and sleep inside the camp at night, making infiltration easier. The game
                has a dynamic weather system, allowing players to take advantages of storms and rain, which mask the
                sounds of Artyom's footsteps. The time of day can be changed at safehouses in the game's world.

                Not all human survivors are hostile; some may provide valuable information and open up new points of
                interest, and some may join Artyom's crew. Subtle moral choices in the game provide karma; good
                karma can be gained by helping non-playable characters, speaking with survivors with Artyom's gun
                holstered, and sparing enemies who have surrendered. Karma affects the ending the player
                experiences.</p>

        <h2>About the Story</h2>
        <h3>Synopsis</h3>

        <section class="block">
            <p>Setting and characters
                Metro Exodus is set in 2035, one year after the events of Metro: Last Light, on a post-apocalyptic Earth
                that has been devastated by a nuclear war. Many parts of the world are uninhabitable due to radiation,
                forcing humans to create communities to survive, and split into factions both peaceful and hostile, who
                often fight against one another and against aggressive mutant creatures that roam the surface and
                underground. The game continues the story from Metro: Last Light's "Redemption" ending. As in the two
                preceding games, the player assumes the role of Artyom, who flees the Moscow Metro and sets off on a
                locomotive called the Aurora with his allies on a journey to the Far East. The story takes place over
                one year, starting with a harsh nuclear winter in the Metro. Anna, another major character in the
                preceding game and the book Metro 2035, is now Artyom's wife. Miller, Anna's father and leader of the
                military Spartan Order in previous games and novels, returns. Artyom's Spartan comrades include Alyosha,
                Damir, Duke, Idiot, Sam, Stepan, and Tokarev. Other characters who join the Aurora crew during their
                journey include an engineer named Yermak, a nurse named Katya, Katya's daughter Nastya, and a mechanic
                named Krest.</p>

        <h3>Plot</h3>
        <section class="block" id="idegesito">
            <p>After the attack on D6, Artyom becomes disillusioned with the constant infighting and corruption within
                the Metro and leaves the Spartan Order. He becomes obsessed with proving other humans outside of Moscow
                have survived and makes numerous dangerous expeditions to the surface. During an expedition with Anna,
                they witness a working train running on the surface. Before they can follow it, they and a group of
                people who claim to be from outside Moscow are captured by Hansa soldiers. The Hansa soldiers execute
                the other prisoners, and Artyom is shot and Anna is taken hostage. Artyom survived the shooting; he
                follows the soldiers to rescue Anna and inadvertently destroys a signal jammer that was blocking all
                radio communications between Moscow and the outside world. Radio transmissions from all over the world
                begin to be received, and Artyom and Anna realize humanity has not gone extinct. They escape by stealing
                one of Hansa's locomotives named Aurora.

                As the train leaves, the Spartan Order moves in to retake it, and are shocked and confused at Artyom's
                and Anna's presence. Knowing Hansa will kill all of them for knowing the truth, Miller concludes the
                Spartans' best chance of survival is to flee Moscow. Once outside the city, Miller tells the others
                while many of Russia's cities were bombed, the war did not end and NATO has occupied the remains of the
                nation. To prevent NATO from attacking Moscow, the Russian leadership decided to secretly jam all
                communications to make the outside world believe nobody had survived. They receive a radio broadcast
                from Moscow Defense Command calling for survivors to rally at the "Ark", which is located at Mount
                Yamantau. Miller decides to go to the Ark, believing the Russian government has rebuilt itself there.

                After crossing the Volga River controlled by a technophobic cult, the Spartans reach the Yamantau base,
                and discover its service-and-construction crew have devolved into cannibals who lure survivors with the
                false promise of safety. Artyom and the Spartans fight their way out and escape. Miller is enraged that
                he and the rest of the Order as well as the people of the Metro have been fooled all along by the
                remnant of the Russian leadership the entire time since there were never any occupation forces and the
                war truly ended the entire time. Using a map they recovered from Yamantau, they travel to a satellite
                communication center near the dried-out Caspian Sea, which is now inhabited by raiders, hoping to gain
                access to a satellite and find habitable land to settle. As the Spartans continue their journey, Anna
                falls ill from previously breathing poison gas at Volga. They scout a nearby taiga forest valley to see
                if it is suitable to settle but find the dam protecting the valley from radiation is about to fail,
                making the area uninhabitable. When Artyom returns, he learns Anna's condition has worsened.

                The Spartans detour to the heavily-irradiated city of Novosibirsk, the closest location where an
                antidote may be found. Despite the risk, Miller and Artyom head into the city alone to search for the
                antidote. They enter the Novosibirsk Metro and find a young boy named Kirill, the last Novosibirsk
                survivor, who explains his father left on a mission to obtain a map marking a clean, habitable area.
                Miller and Artyom split up; Miller goes to find the map and Artyom searches for the antidote. Artyom
                finds the antidote but a mutant gravely wounds him and he absorbs a heavy dose of radiation. Artyom,
                Miller, and Kirill return to the train with the map and the antidote; on the return journey, Miller uses
                a dose of anti-radiation serum meant for himself to save Artyom, and dies of radiation poisoning. The
                rest of the Spartans donate blood to give Artyom a critical transfusion. Anna is cured with the antidote
                and with the map, the Spartans settle on the shores of Lake Baikal, which is free from radiation.

                Artyom's fate depends on the choices the player made during the journey; In the bad ending, Artyom dies
                from the radiation poisoning, the Spartans and a grieving Anna hold a funeral for him and Artyom and
                Miller's spirits awaken on a dilapidated version of the Aurora, remaining for eternity in ghostly
                purgatory. In the good ending, Artyom survives, Miller is buried, and Artyom is selected to replace him
                as leader of the Spartan Order. Now with a radiation-free home, Artyom decides to return to Moscow and
                reveal the truth of the world to the survivors of the Metro.</p>
